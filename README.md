# WEB APPLICATION WITH REACT AND REDUX

Based on the web [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuNEz8XtB51K-x3bwCC9uNM_cxXaiCcRY) by Rem Zolotykh.


## START WITH:
Lesson 4


#### To Run:
```
$ npm run server
```

#### To Stop (on Windows):
```
Ctrl-c
$ taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

### HELPFUL RESOURCES:
* [webpack configuration guide](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/)


## PROJECT NOTES:
#### PACKAGE.JSON
* `scripts: nodemon` watches the server directory for changes and refreshes its execution of `babel-node`
    - `nodemon` is handling the filename `index.js`, not `babel-node`, hence the '--'
    - webpack will take care of the client directory

#### WEBPACK CONFIG
* webpack can take any file (`path: '/'`) because middleware serves from memory (rather than saving a file like 'bundle.js')
* `devtool: 'eval-source-map'` provides more information while debugging making it easier to track down errors
* webpack doesn't know anything about js (or other languages) so the `rules` array tells webpack how to handle certain kinds of files
    - `test` certain file extensions
    - `include` only from a certain directory
    - `loader` using the appropriate loader
* `entry` must be an array as it is used both to serve up the client directory but also it is used by the express middleware
* plugins:
    - `HotModuleReplacementPlugin`: most important
    - `NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin`: cleaner errors


#### BABELRC
* babel does the transpiling of ES6 code
* babel doesn't understand react by default, so add that in there too

#### INDEX.HTML
* the script src is 'bundle.js' but there's no such file in our project. that's because the file is dynamically generated by webpack and served up to the browser

#### INDEX.JS (SERVER)
* define the interface between our express server and our entry point ('index.html')
* configuring webpack
    - we use the webpack config file from our root dir by importing the file and creating `const compiler`
    - then we add configuration specifically for webpackMiddleware with our `app.use()` statements
    - 'noInfo' reduces noise from webpack
* hot middleware is needed for using express

#### INDEX.JS (CLIENT)
* here is where we render the components that will go into 'bundle.js'

#### APP.JS
* __your top component must be a class component rather than a functional component__
    ```javascript
    // CLASS COMPONENT:
    class App extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <h1>Hello Mars!</h1>
            );    
        }
    }
    export default App;
    // VERSUS THE FUNCTIONAL:
    export default () => {
        return (
            <h1>Greetings, Venus!</h1>
        );
    }
    ```


## TO DO:
* `import` statements require extensions -- that's weird. shouldn't webpack be taking care of that?
